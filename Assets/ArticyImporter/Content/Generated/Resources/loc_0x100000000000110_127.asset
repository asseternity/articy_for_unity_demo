  - Hi. Where are we?
  - Hi... I'm not too sure.
  - This is odd, isn't it?
  - I mean, it looks fairly normal. Blue sky, as one'd expect.
  - Green-colored ground to imitate grass, I get what you mean.
  - Let's explore some more. Maybe something will happen.
  - Okay!
  - Who do you think you are, coming up to me, Red, and asking your questions?
  - Ooh, look at the big Red meanie, thinking that he's too cool for school.
  - I am Circle, nice to meet you!
  - Hmph. Fine. I don't know where we are.
  - ' Do you have any guesses?'
  - I dunno. I guess we've got no choice but explore some more.
  - It must be a good place, right? Look at the bright colors!
  - It doesn't feel too good... something's off.
  - Hmm. Maybe you're right.
  - Circle
  - Blue
